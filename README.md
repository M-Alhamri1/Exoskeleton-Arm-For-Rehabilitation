This Exoskeleton Arm is a device that is used for rehabilitation purposes. It is developed to be lightweight, cost-effective and easy to use. 
The device is composed of two motors (one at the elbow and the other at the shoulder), which makes it a two joints robotic arm. It is also designed with a backpack to make it portable so it provides continious therapy. 
Moreover, it is controlled via mobile phone application callled Blynk through various modes. The first one is the excercise mode which continiously move the upper arm or the forearm.
The second mode is the controlled movement, which is moving the arm to a specific angle. 
Last mode is controlling through flex sensor, in which the sensor is mounted on the patient finger and as the patient twist his finger, the sensor also twisted which sends signals to the motors to move the arm. 
Finally, the Arm is made of PETG material which resulted in a reliable device with less cost.
